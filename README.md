#Methods Used and Learnt Creating this Project:
- useState()
- useEffect()
- setInterval()
- clearInterval()
- new Date()
- getHours(), getMinutes(), getSeconds()
- ternary operators(?, :) and || 
- background CSS properties:[background-size, background-image, background-repeat, background-position, background-attribute]

#Logic used to create this digital clock project:
- a function to format the time, changing it from the default military time to regular time
- a function to handle the problem of no 0 digits before a unit number less than 10
- a meridium unit with a ternary operator to properly indicate the time as PM or AM

#Future implementations to add:
- multiple digital clock componenets with unique props, and their own set of conditional rendering. Could be different times in different locations, and different time units.
- possibly an alarm
- a changing background image
- the exact day
- maybe a calender
